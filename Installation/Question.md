### Topics to be Covered:
    Installing Ansible using pip, yum or apt
    Automating Ansible Installation
    Configuration file basics

What You Will Learn:
How easy it is to install and configure Ansible for yourself.


## Assignment:

### Create a utility to install ansible   
- By Default it should install latest version
- but user can give other version as well
- Make sure that all validations are in place. i.e if version mismatch then upgrade should happend if already install then error will be shown.


### Create separate inventory file for each ninja groups (rrr,avengers)
- By default if I run ping command then my controls server should ping servers of my ninja group.

## Do further modification where I can only ping my ninja group servers sequentially, wehreas other  ninja group servers can be pinged simultaneously.
